## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

    <h5 align="left">The summary for the linear regression shows that vehicle length and ground clearance provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values.  The weight the vehicle is approaching a level of significance, but still falls outside the range to disprove the null hypothesis.  Both spoiler angle and AWD show a high factor of random variance.
      
      The slope of the linear model is positive, as the most significant slope factors are shown as vehicle_length and ground_clearance, also have the largest positive impact.  This is further supported by the previous conclusion of these same factors have the highest non-random amount of variance.
      
      Ultimately, this linear model does effectively predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes.  As seen in the summary, the R-squared value is 0.71, which shows that 71% of the variability of the mpg value can be determined from the given linear model.  The overall p-value, 5.35e-11, is much smaller than the assumed significance level of 0.05%.  From this can reject the null hypothesis that this combination of variables has little to no effect on the overall mpg of the prototypes.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition
Write a short description of a statistical study that can quantify how the MechaCar performs against the competition. In your study design, think critically about what metrics would be of interest to a consumer: for a few examples, cost, city or highway fuel efficiency, horse power, maintenance cost, or safety rating.
In your description, address the following questions:
What metric or metrics are you going to test?
What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?
What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?
What data is needed to run the statistical test?
